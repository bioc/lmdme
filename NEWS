ii) lines with at most 80 characters. iii) avoid typo errors.

* URL field in Description file was updated.

DEPENDENCY CHANGES

* stemHypoxia data package was moved back to Depends in order to avoid

  Software).

----------------------------------------------------------------

DEPENDENCY CHANGES

* stemHypoxia data package was moved to Suggests and in examples included the

lmdme 0.99.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

MINOR CHANGES

* Getters now accept a character vector in `term` parameter, in order to 
specify one than one term if required. In addition, `design` and `model` were
added, and `pvalues` like `Fvalues` were changed to match slot names.  (Thanks
to Valerie Obenchain)

* `lmdme` now works with NA presence in data matrix. This bug is related to 
 lmFit intercept coefficient behavior, which breaks the data structure using 
 drop (to numeric instead of keeping a matrix with one column) only if NA are
 present.

* `lmdme` is now the only constructor. Method `initialize` was erased due to
 different reasons as described in
 https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc­devel/2012­August/003554.html

* `decomposition` example sections using `subset` parameter for simplicity (not
 all the data has to be decomposed in the example).

* Enhance of `biplot` and `screeplot` functions with `term` and `mfcol` to
 simplify the graphic output specification.

DOCUMENTATION

* `NEWS` file was added.
