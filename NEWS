DOCUMENTATION

    * Vignette was updated to cope with Journal of Statistical 
    Software article.
    * Minor updates to the man pages.

Changes in version lmdme 1.1.4
----------------------------------------------------------------

MINOR CHANGES

    * Enhance `biplot` function now accepts single character for 
    `xlabs` and `ylabs`. In addition `which` parameter was also 
    included for `plsr`decomposition (Thanks to Editor and two 
    reviewers of Journal of Statistical Software).

Changes in version lmdme 1.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

MAYOR CHANGES

    * `lmDME` on class/files/.Rd names changed to `lmdme` in order 
    to match package name (Thanks to Editor and two reviewers of 
    Journal of Statistical Software).

Changes in version lmdme 1.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

MINOR CHANGES

    * Getters functions for lmDME class now have drop=TRUE parameter,
     in order to avoid using [[1]] when only one term/component is 
    returned (Thanks to Elmer Fernandez).

DOCUMENTATION

    * Missing usage functions helps for F.p.values, p.values, etc. 
    were added.

Changes in version lmdme 1.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

MINOR CHANGES

    * R code, documentation, examples, etc.  were modify to cope 
    with Journal of Statistical Software style rules: i) 2 
    character spaces for indentation. ii) lines with at most 
    80 characters. iii) avoid typo errors.
    * URL field in Description file was updated.

DEPENDENCY CHANGES

    * stemHypoxia data package was moved back to Depends in order 
    to avoid if(required){ #on example code } (Thanks to Editor of 
    Journal of Statistical Software).

Changes in version lmdme 1.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

DEPENDENCY CHANGES

    * stemHypoxia data package was moved to Suggests and in examples 
    included the appropriate if(required){ #example code } (Thanks 
    to Valerie Obenchain).

Changes in version lmdme 0.99.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

MINOR CHANGES

    * Getters now accept a character vector in `term` parameter, in 
    order to specify one than one term if required. In addition, 
    `design` and `model` were added, and `pvalues` like `Fvalues` 
    were changed to match slot names.  (Thanks to Valerie Obenchain)

    * `lmdme` now works with NA presence in data matrix. This bug 
    is related to lmFit intercept coefficient behavior, which breaks 
    the data structure using drop (to numeric instead of keeping a 
    matrix with one column) only if NA are present.

    * `lmdme` is now the only constructor. Method `initialize` was 
    erased due to different reasons as described in
    https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc­devel/2012­August/003554.html

    * `decomposition` example sections using `subset` parameter for 
    simplicity (not all the data has to be decomposed in the example).

    * Enhance of `biplot` and `screeplot` functions with `term` and 
    `mfcol` to simplify the graphic output specification.

DOCUMENTATION

    * `NEWS` file was added.
